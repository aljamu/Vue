1.) Hard Code a h1 and p on the Website. Use Bootstrap to style and <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3"></script> to use Vue without Build Tools

2.) Soft code using Vue -> Provide Data and let it show on the webapp
    Create an Object in the Script (script comes after loading the page=>after h1 and p tag)

3.) Creating another vue app: Nav bar. Hard Coding e.g. Home, About, Contact
3.1) Soft Coding simple Navbar:
    - v:for: instead of Coding a for loop in Javascript we use the Vue directive v-for in the element we want to loop
