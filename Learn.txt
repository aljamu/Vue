1.) Hard Code a h1 and p on the Website. Use Bootstrap to style and <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3"></script> to use Vue without Build Tools

2.) Soft code using Vue -> Provide Data and let it show on the webapp
    Create an Object in the Script (script comes after loading the page=>after h1 and p tag)
